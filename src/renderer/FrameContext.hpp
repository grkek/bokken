         * Per-frame context passed down the Pipeline.
         *
         * Stages read from `inputTarget` (the previous stage's output) and
         * write to `outputTarget` (their own scratch). The Pipeline rotates
         * these between stages so each stage's output becomes the next
         * stage's input.
         *
         * `viewportWidth/Height` are the framebuffer dimensions in physical
         * pixels (HiDPI-aware). Stages that draw screen-aligned content use
         * these to size their work.
         *
         * `dt` is the variable timestep in seconds; useful for time-based
         * post effects (animated noise, scanline scroll, etc).
         *
         * `batcher` is shared — stages that draw 2D content go through it.
