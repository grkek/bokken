         * Helper for post-process stages. Owns a fullscreen triangle VAO
         * and runs a fragment shader over it sampling some input texture.
         *
         * Shaders can be used in two ways:
         *
         *   1. Pre-compiled: call compile() during setup() with a name and
         *      fragment source. Then call bind() by name in execute(). This
         *      is the preferred path — shaders are compiled exactly once and
         *      never touched again.
         *
         *   2. Legacy lazy path: call beginPass() with raw fragment source.
         *      The shader is compiled on first use and cached by pointer
         *      address. This still works but the pre-compiled path avoids
         *      any per-frame string comparison overhead.
         *
         * All compiled shaders share the same built-in fullscreen triangle
         * vertex shader.
         *
         * Why a fullscreen *triangle* instead of two triangles for a quad:
         * a single triangle that overshoots the viewport saves the GPU's
         * triangle setup pipeline a tiny bit and (more practically) avoids
         * a hairline seam down the middle of the screen on some drivers.
         * Standard trick, costs nothing.
