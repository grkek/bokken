 * Bokken — public engine entry point.

 * defined as preprocessor macros consumed by Bokken.cpp inside the engine
 * library, so changing them means rebuilding the engine, not the consumer.
 *
 *   BOKKEN_PROJECT_PATH   - path to project.bokken    ("project.bokken")
 *   BOKKEN_SCRIPT_PACK    - script asset pack         ("assets/scripts.assetpack")
 *   BOKKEN_ENVIRONMENT    - environment string        ("development")
 *   BOKKEN_FIXED_HZ       - fixed-step rate           (60)
 *   BOKKEN_ENTRY_SCRIPT   - entry script in pack      ("/scripts/index.script")
